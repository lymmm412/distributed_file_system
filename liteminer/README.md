# LiteMiner

Add your README here!

## Extra features we added
We add four member variables to **Pool sturct** so that we can control the communication between pool and miners more easily:

```
  	Intv     []Interval    // Save the intervals generated by GenerateIntervals()
	Data     string        // Transaction message
	Results  []Message     // Save the ProofOfWork sent from miners
	WorkChan chan Interval // Channel for work to be done
```
With these variables, we can delete miners and re-assign work to miners easily when some miners are slow or not responding. For the unprocessed work, we just simply append the work back to WorkChan.
## Overview of our tests

In the test file, we add another three test functions. The coverage of our test is 77.8%. 

In the ```TestMiners```function, we shut down all the miners and the pool outputs the warning that all the miners are disconnected. 

In the ```TestClients``` function, we connect two pools to the same client and the client output an error message: Received unexpected message of type 2 (ErrorMsg) from pool. 

In the ```TestPools``` function, we connect two clients to the same pool and the client outputs the warning that pool is currently busy and disconnect the pool.
